## ⚡ Deployment Notes
- **will-change usage:**  
  In the CSS, `will-change: transform, opacity;` was intentionally applied to `.contact-column` to improve animation smoothness for that section (because it animates on scroll-in).  
  This was not globally applied to avoid unnecessary memory usage or paint performance hits.
- All images are optimized; consider further compression for production (e.g. using TinyPNG or similar tools).
- Favicon included (`/assets/images/favicon.ico`).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. For local server testing (recommended for JS/CSS file linking):  
   Run:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
