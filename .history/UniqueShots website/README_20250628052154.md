🧠 Developer Notes
This site is 100% custom coded — no frameworks.

Mobile-first design was used, with breakpoints at 768px, 480px, and 320px.

Applied will-change selectively on animated sections (e.g. .contact-column) for performance optimization and reduce repaint/reflow

Animations were handled with CSS only (no JavaScript dependencies yet).

Designed with aesthetic clarity, performance, and UX in mind



💡 Future Improvements
Add backend support for the contact form (e.g., Formspree or Node.js)

Integrate a gallery modal viewer for project images

Add animations using JavaScript or GSAP

Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels)

Dark mode toggle
